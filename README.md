# Atomic Orbitals of Hydrogen
The hydrogen wave function can be written as,

![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi_{n,l,m}(r)&space;=&space;Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)e^{-r/na_{1}}(\frac{r}{a_{1}})^{l}L_{n-l-1}(r))
- ![equation2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)), spherical harmonic,
- ![equation3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L_{n-l-1}(r)), a Laguerre polynomial.

The aim of the program is to simulate the possible electrons' position of the hydrogen atom in different states. The main steps of the program for each states are :
1. A 3D arbitrary grid is created.
2. The hydrogen wavefunction is calculated for each portion of space. The positive part is separated from the negative one, and their respective probabilities are determined independently.
3. The electrons' coordinates are generated randomly following these two different probability laws. The electrons following the negative probability will be "flipped" in the space i.e. their coordinates' sign will switch, in order to reproduce the "negativity" of their wavefunction.
4. Then, depending on each state, the electron's coordinates will be plotted with a color code revealing the most likely electron's positions.

Thanks to this approach, we can observe that the electrons will form atomic orbitals that we can compare to the litterature.

## Structure of the project
Below are the steps needed in order to start the program and to plot the results:
1. First, the user has to choose the initial 3D grid geometry, the number of coordinates, the specific orbital of the hydrogen and the probabilities of presence he wants to put forward.  This can be done in the two configuration files : [simulation configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/ef0252217abe2e4b3c39d2659da81562aa5215c8/config_simulation210.txt) and [plot configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/b587c0f6da051b77be8b47f6628081cdbb259a4a/config_plot210.txt). There are physical selection rules for the numbers n, l and m that the user should respect in order to avoid an error message. The initial 3D grid must be defined to have enough data with a small calculation time. The values ![equation3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?dz&space;=&space;0.5), ![equation4](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_{min}&space;=&space;-10) and ![equation5](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z_{max}&space;=&space;10) permit a good balance.  The number of coordinates must be chosen with attention for the same reasons. By default, it is settled as ![equation6](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{6}) but it must be much larger for the levels l = 0, m = 0. Notice that the choice of probabilities of presence will influence the shape of the orbital, and this is why it must be chosen carefully.
2. Then, the user have to launch the [simulation](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/de85d5e009ced667e0141f3a0d8e6c4123cfd2d2/simulation.py) file, which imports the parameters of the [simulation configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/ef0252217abe2e4b3c39d2659da81562aa5215c8/config_simulation210.txt) file through the ConfigParser library. It constructs the probability laws in agreement with the orbital selected earlier, and they are saved in a data folder thanks to the [simulation configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/ef0252217abe2e4b3c39d2659da81562aa5215c8/config_simulation210.txt) file.
3. Finally, the [plot configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/b587c0f6da051b77be8b47f6628081cdbb259a4a/config_plot210.txt) file downloads the probabilities from the data folder. The latter are used to create the coordinates. The user has to launch the [plots](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/5c4a491834a57a51ed0aa21658dc98df6b3fecb9/plots.py) file to visualize the electrons' position in 3D. The plots are loaded through their local paths thanks to the [plot configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/b587c0f6da051b77be8b47f6628081cdbb259a4a/config_plot210.txt) file and then they are saved in the images folder automatically.



This project is divided into five blocks :
- In the [functions](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/940fe41fe7cd766f584223bdf788edfa74fe2dde/functions.py) file, all the functions are stored. They are tools used for the construction of the data.
- In the [TEST](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/270d73a5cbd91113226b05de11b54120ec58fd4f/TEST.py) file, the functions are tested, to ensure as much as possible that the program is working properly.
- In the configuration files there are the definitions of the parameters used in the simulation and the plot file : the initial 3D grid, the specific orbital (n,l,m), the number of coordinates we want to simulate and the local paths of the data generated by the [simulation](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/de85d5e009ced667e0141f3a0d8e6c4123cfd2d2/simulation.py) file. In the [plot configuration](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/b587c0f6da051b77be8b47f6628081cdbb259a4a/config_plot210.txt) file there is in addition parameters needed to perform the plotting : the range of probabilities we want to observe, the random seed and the local paths in order to load and save the plots in a folder named "Images".  
- In the [simulation](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/de85d5e009ced667e0141f3a0d8e6c4123cfd2d2/simulation.py) file there is the main part of the code. It will calculate the wavefunction of each point in the 3D grid for the specific orbital. Then the "positive" and "negative" parts of the wavefunction are used to calculate their respective probabilities.
- In the [plots](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/5c4a491834a57a51ed0aa21658dc98df6b3fecb9/plots.py) file the coordinates are generated by using the probability laws calculated in the [simulation](https://github.com/Laurecaz/Software-and-Computing-for-Applied-Physics/blob/de85d5e009ced667e0141f3a0d8e6c4123cfd2d2/simulation.py) file and they are then plotted in 3 dimensions using matplotlib.pyplot, with a color code according to the chosen probabilities of presence.
